# Hi, I'm Hadock.

- I’m currently learning the basics of Rust!
- Ask me about something I made, and I'll try my best to help!

### Hopes and Dreams
I hope to work in a tech related environment, I would love to have a job in Web Development, Software Development, IT, SysAdmin and Data Science, just to name a few areas.

I also want to make my own Home Infrastructure; It would be so fun to set up to my liking.

### My work experience
I have previously worked on a few projects, most notably my bot and website. It was fun learning to do different things and understanding how it works.
I've also worked on a few other projects off-git with some friends.

### How do I reach out to you?
You can reach out to me by going to my [website](https://hadock.tech/contact.html). There's various ways to contact me, you can also open an issue in any of my personal repos as that will show up in my email.

## My programming roadtrip
