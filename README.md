# Hi, I'm Hadock.

- Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of C!
- Ask me about something I made, and I'll try my best to help!

### Hopes and Dreams
I hope to work in a tech related environment, I would love to have a job in Web Development, Software Development, IT, SysAdmin and Data Science, just to name a few areas.

I also want to make my own Home Infrastructure; It would be so fun to set up to my liking.

### My work experience
I have previously worked on a few projects, most notably my bot and website. It was fun learning to do different things and understanding how it works.
I've also worked on a few other projects off-git with some friends.

### How do I reach out to you?
Contact me using the email in my commits.
